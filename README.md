# polynomialFitterShinyApp Repository

This repo contains R code in two different but equivalent forms for a 
Shiny app that allows you to do polynomial curve fitting on data passed to the 
app via a .csv file.  The alternate code implementations are:

* `app.R`: a single-file implementation of the app (the newest way of doing 
Shiny apps)
* `ui.R` and `server.R`: an old-style two-file implememtation of the same 
app
